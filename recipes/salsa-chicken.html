        <p>
            This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! 
            Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, 
            and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste,
             you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it 
             with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.
