# odin-recipes

This is the first HTML project for The Odin Project coursework. 

odin-recipes will be a basic recipe website and I'll keep adding styling and probably some interaction in time. 

For now, I'll just build the basic layout via the things that I learned on the HTML Foundations course. Which consists: creating an HTML file with a boilerplate, adding headings and paragraphs, adding links & images, making ordered & unordered lists.
